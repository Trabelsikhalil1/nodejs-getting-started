# gauntlt/attacks/sslyze_no_anon.attack

Feature: Run sslyze against a target

  Background:
    Given "sslyze" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name     | value      |
      | hostname | github.com |

  @slow
  Scenario: Ensure no anonymous cipher suites are accepted
    When I launch an "sslyze" attack with:
      """
      python -u <sslyze_path> <hostname>:443
      """
    Then the output should not contain:
      """
      Anon
      """
